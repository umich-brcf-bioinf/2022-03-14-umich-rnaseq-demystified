1. Watch the <a href="https://www.mivideo.it.umich.edu/media/t/1_tx74a3v9" target="_blank">Intro to RNA-Seq Webinar<a/><br/>
The hands-on workshop builds on the content of this 1-hour webinar that introduces foundational concepts of RNA-Seq experiments including experimental design, sample preparation, QC, sequencing, and initial interpretation of preliminary results.

2. (optional) If you have not already, we invite you to take the <a href="https://forms.gle/UdyurdLkmaguyW3G6" target="_blank">Pre-workshop survey</a><br/>

3. Follow this link for <a href="setup_instructions.html" target="_blank">instructions to set up your computer</a><br/>
A separate email with the subject **"UM BioinfCore Workshop Login"** will detail your individual username and password to access the shared server. (Note that this email is sometimes flagged as spam, so if you don't see it in your Inbox please check your spam folder.)

4. We will be using the same Slack space as COmputational Foundations and have added you to the 2022-03-rnaseq-demystified-workshop Slack channel<br/>

5. (optional) Brush up your <a href="https://umich-brcf-bioinf.github.io/2022-02-28-umich-computational-foundations/html/" target="_blank">Bash/R skills</a>.<br/>
Notes from a recent Bioinf Core workshop on key ideas/techniques.

We are looking forward to seeing you in the workshop. Please let us know if you have any questions.<br/><br/>
